  Credit is also due to those who have published information about backgammon
   playing programs (references will appear here later).  GNU Backgammon has
                              borrowed ideas from:

             Hans Berliner   Rick Janowski   Gerry Tesauro   Michael Zehr
             Chuck Bower     Brian Sheppard  Morten Wang

       
    The manual for GNU Backgammon includes a chapter describing the rules of
      backgammon, written by Tom Keith for his Backgammon Galore web site
                             <http://www.bkgm.com/>.


  Library code from the following authors has been included in GNU Backgammon:

     Ulrich Drepper (an implementation of the public domain MD5 algorithm)
             Bob Jenkins (the ISAAC pseudo random number generator)
       Takuji Nishimura and Makoto Matsumoto (the Mersenne Twister PRNG)
                Gerry Tesauro (the "pubeval" position evaluator)
