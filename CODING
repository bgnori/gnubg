Making your own branch of the GNU Backgammon code
=================================================

Create the branch
-----------------

On a clean copy of the gnubg sources:

cvs rtag -b branch-xxx gnubg
cvs rtag branch-point-xxx gnubg
cvs rtab branch-xxx-merged gnubg

The first creates the branch. The second and third are symbolic tags
needed for merging later on.


You can now switch your working copy onto the branch-xxx with
 
cvs update -r branch-xxx

You're now working on the branch.
CHeck with "cvs status gnubg.c". It should say something like:
 
===================================================================
File: gnubg.c           Status: Locally Modified

   Working revision:    1.417
   Repository revision: 1.417           /cvsroot/gnubg/gnubg/gnubg.c,v
   Sticky Tag:          branch-xxx (branch: 1.417.x)
   Sticky Date:         (none)
   Sticky Options:      (none)

You can now commit your patches with

cvs add <the files you've added>
cvs ci <the files you've updated and added>


Merge changes from main trunk into your branch
----------------------------------------------

It's basically doing a

cvs update -jbranch-xxx-merged -jHEAD file1 file2 ...

or just

cvs update -jbranch-xxx-merged -jHEAD 

when positioned in your xxx-tree.

After a successful merge you should move the branch-xxx-merged tag to
the HEAD by issuing:

cvs rtag -F branch-xxx-merged

By moving the tag you can do a merge as often as you like. The "cvs
rtag" command is substantially faster when issuing it per file.


Merge your branch into the main trunk
-------------------------------------

Check out a copy of the main trunk and then merge the branch with

cvs update -j branch-xxx

Resolve any conflicts and check in the newly merged files (there shouldn't
be any confilcts if you first merge the latest main trunk changes as shown above).

It's probably a good idea to mark the branch at this point so that further
changes to the branch can be merged into the trunk with

cvs update -j branch-xxx-mergedwithtrunk -j branch-xxx
