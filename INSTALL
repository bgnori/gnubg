Installation
============

Installing gnubg is rather painless through the use of the GNU autoconf
package.  Simply untar the gnubg distribution, and run the ``configure''
script. Then ``make´´ and then as root ``make install´´.  If you have obtained
the distribution from the CVS repository, run ``./autogen.sh'' first.

You are likely to want or need the following tools

autoconf
automake
bison
flex
gcc
libtool
GNU make

and development libraries

glib2 (_Required_)
png (_Required_)
xml2 (_Required_)
freetype2 (_Required_)

gtk2 (GUI)
cairo2 (graphics)
esound (sound)
gtkglext (3d boards)
readline (command line)
python (extension)
sqlite3 (database)
gmp3 (better random numbers)

In most cases, configure will automatically determine everything it needs to
know in order to compile.  However, there are a few options to ``configure'' to
help it out, or to disable a certain feature. See ``configure --help´´ for more
info.

  --enable-sse=TYPE       enable SSE for newer cpus(TYPE=yes,no,cputest, default cputest)
  --enable-threads        enable multithread support (Default disabled)
  --with-gtk              use GTK+ 2.0 (Default if found)
  --with-board3d          compile with 3D boards (Default if found)
  --with-python[=PYTHON]  absolute path name of Python executable
