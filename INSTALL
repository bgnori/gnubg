Installation
============

Installing gnubg is rather painless through the use of the GNU autoconf
package.  Simply untar the gnubg distribution, and run the ``configure''
script. Then ``make´´ and then as root ``make install´´.  If you have obtained
the distribution from the CVS repository, run ``./autogen.sh'' first.  It will
set up gnubg's build environment and add the files which are present in the tar
balls, but not in the CVS repository.


You are likely to want or need the following tools and libraries

autoconf
automake
bison
gcc
gnuplot
libtool
make

libatk1.0-dev

In most cases, configure will automatically determine everything it needs to
know in order to compile.  However, there are a few options to ``configure'' to
help it out, or to disable a certain feature.

--enable-sse               enable SSE for newer cpus (recommended)
--without-board3d          don't provide 3D boards
--without-timecontrol      don't provide clocks (recommended)
--without-gdbm             don't use GNU dbm for databases (recommended)
--without-gtk2             don't use GTK+ 2.0 (the graphical interface)
--without-python           don't provide Python scripts inside gnubg
--without-sound            don't use sounds with GNU Backgammon
