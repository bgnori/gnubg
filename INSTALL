Installation
============

Installing gnubg is rather painless through the use of the GNU autoconf
package.  Simply untar the gnubg distribution, and run the ``configure''
script. Then ``make´´ and then as root ``make install´´.  If you have obtained
the distribution from the CVS repository, run ``./autogen.sh'' first.

You are likely to want or need the following tools

autoconf
automake
bison
flex
gcc
libtool
GNU make

and development libraries

cairo
esound
glib (_Required_)
gtk
gtkglext
png
readline
xml2
python

In most cases, configure will automatically determine everything it needs to
know in order to compile.  However, there are a few options to ``configure'' to
help it out, or to disable a certain feature. See ``configure --help´´ for more
info.

  --enable-sse=TYPE       enable SSE for newer cpus(TYPE=yes,no,cputest, default cputest)
  --enable-threads        enable multithread support (Default disabled)
  --with-gtk              use GTK+ 2.0 (Default if found)
  --with-board3d          compile with 3D boards (Default if found)
  --with-python[=PYTHON]  absolute path name of Python executable
