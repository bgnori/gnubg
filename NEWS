GNU Backgammon NEWS -- history of user-visible changes.  19 Feb 2000

** Clicking on the cube in the board window is equivalent to the command
"double".

** The board window now gives better feedback about any move (if the move
is a partial or complete legal move, it is displayed, otherwise "Illegal move"
is shown).  Chequers may be moved around without restriction, and all legal
moves will be recognised.

** The player names now default to the user's login name and "gnubg".

** Added --no-weights option to disable reading weights files.  Generate
and use binary weight files if available.

** Optional automatic bearoffs in non-contact positions ("set autobearoff").

** Match and session play has been added, along with support for the
Crawford and Jacoby rules, and automatic doubles.

** Allow alternate style of moving chequers in board window with mouse
buttons 2 and 3.

** Added support for other dice generators ("set rng").
