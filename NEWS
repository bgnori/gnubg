GNU Backgammon NEWS -- history of user-visible changes.  19 October 2000

** .SGF format support for loading and saving added.

** Cubeful evaluation added.

** You can now load and save settings, and specify startup commands in a
~/.gnubgrc file.

** Added GTK+ port, and many associated features.

** MD5 dice generation added.

** Added command line options `-d' (--datadir), `-b' (--no-bearoff) and
`-w' (--window-system-only).

** Reduced searches added.

** "!" shell escapes added.

** Allow finer grained "set evaluation" commands (rollouts, each player,
and "eval"/"hint" use separate settings).

** Added Nackgammon option.

** Clicking on the cube in the board window is equivalent to the command
"double".

** The board window now gives better feedback about any move (if the move
is a partial or complete legal move, it is displayed, otherwise "Illegal move"
is shown).  Chequers may be moved around without restriction, and all legal
moves will be recognised.

** The player names now default to the user's login name and "gnubg".

** Added --no-weights option to disable reading weights files.  Generate
and use binary weight files if available.

** Match and session play has been added, along with support for the
Crawford and Jacoby rules, and automatic doubles.

** The position ID is now displayed in board window.

** Allow alternate style of moving chequers in board window with mouse
buttons 2 and 3.

** Added support for other dice generators ("set rng").

** Many miscellaneous commands implemented.

** More bug fixes.
