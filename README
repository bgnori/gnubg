GNU Backgammon 0.12
===================

This is a pre-release version of GNU Backgammon (gnubg), a backgammon
player and analysis tool.  Please send comments and suggestions to
<bug-gnubg@gnu.org>.

Look for news and upcoming releases of GNU Backgammon at:
    http://www.gnu.org/software/gnubg/gnubg.html

For instructions on how to build gnubg, please read the file `INSTALL'
and the other sections in this file; for other information, please see
the GNU Backgammon manual in the `doc' directory.

Current features:
-----------------

 - Support for both 1-sided and 2-sided bearoff databases: built-in 1-sided
   bearoff databases for 15 chequers on the first 6 points is kept in 
   memory. Optional 2-sided databases to be kept in memory, as well
   as optional larger 1-sided and 2-sided databases stored on disk.
 - Neural net functions for giving cubeless evaluations of all other
   contact and race positions
 - Functions to generate legal moves and evaluate positions at varying
   search depths
 - Tournament match and money session cube handling
 - A command line interface (with full command editing features if GNU
   readline is available) that lets you play matches and sessions against
   gnubg
 - Support for either a GTK+ interface with a graphical board window, or
   a rough ASCII representation of a board on text terminals
 - Automated rollouts of positions, with lookahead and race variance
   reduction where appropriate
 - Both TD(0) and supervised training of neural net weights
 - Position databases for supervised training (if GNU dbm is available)
 - Loading and saving .sgf games and matches (.sgf files are in the
   Smart Game Format)
 - Exporting games and matches to .mat, LaTeX, PostScript and PDF formats
 - Importing .pos, .mat, .sgg and FIBS "oldmoves" files
 - Scripting ability (if GNU Guile is available)
 - Automatic and manual annotation (analysis and commentary) of games and
   matches

Bearoff databases:
------------------

  GNU Backgammon is designed to work with files containing databases
of endgame positions, to evaluate moves and cube decisions during the bearoff.  These files may be several megabytes large, and are generally slow to generate,
so they are not included in the distribution.

The "make" process will warn you if do not have "gnubg_ts0.bd", which is the
2-sided database that is read into memory when GNU Backgammon starts.
If you see this warning, you have three options:

  1) Ignore the database file.  You can run gnubg without the 2-sided
     database.

  2) Generate the file yourself.  You can do this with the command
     "make bearoff-database".  This procedure might take half an hour
     or more, depending on the speed of your computer.

  3) Obtain a copy of the database from the Internet.  It is available
     by FTP from:

        ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/gnubg/gnubg_ts0.bd.gz

     Make sure you decompress the file (with gunzip) once you have
     retrieved it, and move it to the directory containing this README
     file.

You may also generate larger 1-sided and 2-sided bearoff databases that are
stored on disk and not read into memory. If present, GNU Backgammon will
read a 2-sided bearoff databases from the file "gnubg_ts.bd". You can 
generate such a 2-sided database with "makebearoff", for example, up to 
8 chequers on 6 points:

   makebearoff -t 6x8 -f gnubg_ts.bd

Note that this database is 72 megabytes and may take up to several hours to
generate (depending on the speed of your computer). 

Also, if present GNU Backgammon will use a 1-sided database from the file
"gnubg_os.bd". You can generate a one-sided databases with 15 chequers on
10 points with

   makebearoff -o 10 -f gnubg_os.bd

Note that this database is 118 megabtes and may take up to several hours
to generate (depending on the speed of your computer).

Huge bearoff databases may be made available for download for time in
the future. Watch for announcements in <URL:nntp:/rec.games.backgammon> or on
the mailing list bug-gnubg@gnu.org.


The files `gnubg.weights' and `gnubg.wd':
-----------------------------------------

  The weights for gnubg's neural nets are stored in the files
`gnubg.weights' and `gnubg.wd'.  `gnubg.weights' is in ASCII format,
while `gnubg.wd' is a binary file.  However, both contain the same
information; you only need one of the two.  The advantage of
`gnubg.weights' is that it is platform independent; the advantage of
`gnubg.wd' is that it is somewhat smaller and much faster to load.
The build procedure will automatically generate `gnubg.wd' from
`gnubg.weights', if you have it.

  Although it is possible to run GNU Backgammon without a neural net
weight file at all (it will generate random weights), we recommend
that you obtain pre-trained weights; a file compatible with this
pre-release is available at:

        ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/gnubg/gnubg.weights-0.12.gz

Make sure you decompress the file (with gunzip) and rename it to
`gnubg.weights' in the same directory as this README file.


Thanks for trying GNU Backgammon!
