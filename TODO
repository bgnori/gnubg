* Check "show" exists for every "set"!
* Allow setting long seeds for dice generators that support them.  Support
/dev/random for seed generation where available.
* Add cube handling for computer player.
* Add options for Jacoby/cubeless.
* Finish saving positions and evaluations to databases.
* Finish matches and money sessions.
* Finish supervised training, aand allow people to submit training data via
web.
* Use Guile if available.
* Add more completions to help and readline.
* Allow user to vary parameters for rollouts.
* Allow timeouts for "train" (and others?).
* Add a neural net to correct errors in BEAROFF1 class.
* Load, save and analyse games and matches.
* Add "set autobearoff".
* Write a proper input routine which will read a line from stdin under all
conditions (with or without X, with or without readline, and whether
stdin is a TTY or not).  Let the user configure the prompt (add escape
sequences to display information such as the player on roll, pip count,
match score, etc.).  Also, echo commands input with the mouse as if they
had been typed.
* Add Gnome support.  (Better to wait until Gnome is rock solid, I think.)
Add silly bells and whistles like colour selector for chequer colours,
angle of light, surface of pieces, transparent background, etc.
* When getpwnam() or equivalent is available, set the player name to the
user's name.
* Allow copy/paste and drag & drop of the board ID in the board window.
* Perform better move checking in the X window; provide visual feedback
so the user can tell whether the move is partial, complete, or illegal.
* Improve the evaluator!
