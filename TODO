People's names next to entries in this file mean they intend to work on that
item soon.  Please contact them before working on related areas, to avoid
duplication of effort and to make sure our changes merge easily.

* Evaluations:
** Add more evaluation classes.
*** Add a neural net to correct errors in BEAROFF1 class.
*** Classes for bearing off against contact, back games, containment
  positions, prime-vs-prime...
*** Consider meta-pi scheme for using output from multiple nets.
** Add partial searching.
** Merge Joseph Heled's faster evaluation code.

* Game play:
** Add cube handling for computer player.
** Add option for cubeless play.
** Finish matches and money sessions.  (Should be done now I think -- anything
  else I've forgotten?)

* Command interface:
** Check "show" exists for every "set"!
** Allow setting long seeds for dice generators that support them.  Support
  /dev/random for seed generation where available.
** Add more completions to help and readline.
** Allow user to vary parameters for rollouts.
** Allow timeouts for "train" (and others?).
** Load, save and analyse games and matches.  Also load matches given
  as command line parameters.
** Finish saving positions and evaluations to databases.
** Finish supervised training, and allow people to submit training data via
  web.
** Write a proper input routine which will read a line from stdin under all
  conditions (with or without X, with or without readline, and whether
  stdin is a TTY or not).  Echo commands input with the mouse as if they had
  been typed. (gary)
** Be more liberal in the move syntax accepted. (gary)
** Finish "help" -- add detailed help for each command.
** Allow changing the eval cache size. (gary)
** Add undo, reroll, and viewing next/prev moves in game/match. (gary)
** Add "!" as a shell escape.
** Add ":" as a Guile escape, once it's here.

* X interface:
** Get rid of Xmu calls in ext (they're not really portable). (gary)
** Allow copy/paste and drag & drop of the board ID in the board window. (gary)
** Make sure the board window behaves properly with ICCCM things.  Maybe
  some of this should wait for Gnome.
** Keyboard input (or at least some of it) to the board window could
  be redirected to $WINDOWID. (gary)
** Allow doubling by clicking the cube in the board window.  (gary)
** Add an option to slow down display if moves happen too quickly (e.g.
  computer move, unable to move, auto bearoff, etc.)
** Perform better move checking in the X window; provide visual feedback
  so the user can tell whether the move is partial, complete, or illegal.
** Add a board edit mode.  What would be the best semantics for the
  interface?
** Add Gnome support.
  Better to wait until Gnome is rock solid, I think.
*** Add silly bells and whistles.
  Things like colour selector for chequer colours, angle of light,
  surface of pieces, transparent background, etc.  This may also allow
  us to fix the problem of being unresponsive to X events during long
  computations, which I don't think is worth fixing until then.
*** Add menus and dialogs so that games can be played without the
  terminal window at all.

* Bugs:
** Rolling out a perfect evaluation gives SD NaN, rather than 0. (gary)
** Evaluations bearing off against contact and in back games are poor.
** Equity SD should be SD(sum(probabilities)), not sum(SD(probabilities)).
  (gary)
** Think about what should happen with variance reduction in Rollout()
  and RolloutGame() when a probability turns out <0 or >1.
** The board window, and NeuralNetCreate() and NeuralNetResize, use
  random() for their own purposes.  This will disturb the seed for
  the BSD dice generator. (gary)

* Miscellaneous:
** Add internationalisation (gettext).
** Use Guile if available.
** Add a self-test to the distribution.
** Add more to http://www.gnu.org/software/gnubg/... -- definitely the
  HTML formatted manual, and perhaps pages to submit training data,
  an online evaluator like Monte Carlo, maybe even an entire game like
  Motif.
** Complete the Texinfo manual, which is barely started.  Perhaps for now,
  only things that are unlikely to change should be documented.
** When $USER, $LOGNAME, getlogin(), getpwnam() or equivalent is available,
  set the player name to the user's name.  (Maybe this isn't a good idea.)
