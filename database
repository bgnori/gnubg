# all specifications for the match/game database begin with the text gnubg*

# type = postgres or sqlite, maybe mysql somedoay
gnubg*type postgres

# parameters used during connect for storing/retreiving matches/games
# for sqlite, this is only dbname
# for postgresql:
#   dsn         Data source name host:database:user:password:options:tty
#               trailing fields and their ':' can be omitted
#               localhost:gnubg:mylogin:mypass defaults options and tty

#   database    Database name (optional)
#   host, user, password and database will override those
#               parts of the dsn. If you need a non-default port no
#               you have to supply the host line
#   parameters can contain embedded white space if they are surrounded
#   by single or double quotes (so single or double quotes can also be 
#   included, but not both in the same parameter:
#   gnubg password 'this is my password'
#   gnubg password "it's a secret"

#gnubg*user jes
#gnubg*host localhost:5432
gnubg*database gnubg
#gnubg*password "abcdef ghig"
# this line, tells gnubg to include details of individual
# games
gnubg*games no

# parameters used during connect for storing/retreiving errors
# see above notes (still in development)
