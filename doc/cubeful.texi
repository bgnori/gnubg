@chapter Cubeful equities

This chapter is a brief description of how @gnubg{} calculates cubeful
equities. The formulae build directly on the work by Rick Janowski 
@uref{http://www.msoworld.com/mindzine/news/classic/bg/cubeformulae.html,Take-Points
in Money Games} from 1993.

@section Basic formulae for cubeful equities

The basic formulae for cubeful equities as derived by Janowski is

@tex
$$ E(cubeful) = E(dead) \cdot (1-x) + E(live) \cdot x.
@end tex
@ifnottex
@quotation
E(cubeful) = E(dead) * (1-x) + E(live) * x,
@end quotation
@end ifnottex

where E(dead) is the dead cube equity (cubeless equiti) calculated
from the standard formulae. E(live) is the cubeful equity assuming a
fully live cube. We'll return to that in the next section. x is the cube
efficiency. x=0 gives E(cubeful)=E(dead) as one extreme and x=1 gives
E(cubeful)=E(live) as the other extreme. In reality x is somewhere
inbetween, which typical values around 0.6 - 0.8. 

Janowski's article doesn't mention cubeful equities, so we use the
straightforward generalisation

@tex
$$ MWC(cubeful) = MWC(dead) \cdot (1-x) + MWC(live) \cdot x.
@end tex
@ifnottex
@quotation
MWC(cubeful) = MWC(dead) * (1-x) + MWC(live) * x.
@end quotation
@end ifnottex

as MWC is the entity that is used for match play evaluations. 


@section Live cube equities

The live cube equity is the equity assuming that the equity changes
continously, so that doubles and takes occurs exactly at the double
point and take point. For gammonless play this is the well-known take
point of 20%. Janowski derives the more general formula

@tex
$$ TP = \frac{L-0.5}{W+L+0.5}
@end tex
@ifnottex
@quotation
TP = (L-0.5)/(W+L+0.5)
@end quotation
@end ifnottex

where W is the average cubeless value of games ultimately won, and L
is the average cubeless value of games ultimately lost. For example,
for the following position

@gnubg{} evaluates

@example
        Win     W(g)    W(bg)   L(g)    L(bg)   
static: 0.454   0.103   0.001   0.106   0.003   
@end example

and hence W=(0.454 + 0.103 + 0.001)/0.454=1.229 and
L=(0.556+0.106+0.003)/0.556) = 1.196. For gammonless positions, e.g.,
a race, W=1 and L=1.

The live cube equity is now based on piecewise linear interpolation
between the points (0%,-L%), (TP,-1), (CP,+1), and (100%,+W): if my
winning chance is 0 I lose L points, at my take point I lose 1 point,
at my cash point I cash 1 point, and when I have a certain win I win W
points:

@multitable @columnfractions 0.67 0.33
@item @image{mgtp}
@tab @strong{Figure X} Fully live cubeful equity
@end multitable


For match play there is no simple formula, since redoubles can only
occur a limited number of times. 

The live cube take point is generally calculated as

TP(live, n Cube)=TP(dead, n cube) * (1 - TP(live, 2n cube)

So to calculate the live cube take points for a 1-cube at 3-0 to 7 we
need the live cube take points for the 4-cube and the 2-cube. For the
position above and using
Woolsey's match equity table the live cube take point are:

@multitable @columnfractions 0.3 0.3 0.3
@item @strong{Cube value}
@tab @strong{TP for X}
@tab @strong{TP for O}
@item 4  @tab   0%   @tab 41%
@item 2  @tab  15%   @tab 38.5%
@item 1  @tab  24.5% @tab 27.3%
@end multitable

The calculation of these are left as an exercise to the reader.

Ignoring backgammons, the gammon rates for O and X are 0.106/54.6=19%
and 0.103/0.454=22%, respectively. If O wins the game his MWC will be

81% * MWC(-3,-7) + 19% * MWC(-2,-7) = 78%

and if X wins his MWC will be

78% * MWC(-4,-6) + 22% * MWC(-4,-5) = 41%.

If O cashes 1 point he has MWC(-3,-7)=76% and if X cashes he has
MWC(-4,-6)=36%. Analogous to money game the live cube MWC is
calculated as piecewise linear interpolation between (0%,22%),
(24.5%,24%), (72.7%,36%), and (100%,41%) (from X's point of view):

@section 0-ply Cubeful equities

Having established the live cube equities and MWCs we're now in
position to calculate the 0-ply cubeful equities. 

Let's start with money game: the cubeless equity is -0.097 and the
live cube equity can be determined from Figure X as -0.157. Thus, the
cubeful equity is -0.138.


For the match play example at the score 3-0 the cubeless MWC is 29.1%
and from Figure X using wins=45.4% we can determine the live cube MWC
to be 29.2%. Using a value of x=0.68 we arrive at a cubeful MWC of 29.17%.
