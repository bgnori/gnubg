GNU Backgammon (<tt>gnubg</tt>) plays and analyses backgammon games and matches.
   </para>
   <para>
It is currently a work-in-progress.  So far it is able to play
individual games and tournament matches, evaluate and roll out
positions, tune its own evaluation functions using either
<uref><urefurl>http://www.research.ibm.com/massdist/tdl.html</urefurl><urefreplacement>TD</urefreplacement></uref> or supervised
training, maintain databases of positions for training and other
purposes, and more.
   </para>
   <para>
It is driven by a command-line interface, and displays an ASCII
rendition of a board on text-only terminals, but also allows the user to
play games and manipulate positions with a GTK+
<uref><urefurl>http://www.gnu.org/software/gnubg/board.png</urefurl><urefreplacement>board window</urefreplacement></uref> where
available.  It is extensible on platforms which support
<uref><urefurl>http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/guile.html</urefurl><urefreplacement>Guile</urefreplacement></uref>.
   </para>
   <para>
It currently plays at about the level of a championship flight
tournament player (depending on its parameters and its luck in recent
games, it rates from around 1900 to 2000 on
<indexterm index="cp">FIBS</indexterm><uref><urefurl>http://www.fibs.com/</urefurl><urefreplacement>FIBS</urefreplacement></uref>, the First Internet Backgammon Server
-- at its strongest, it ranks in the top 5 of over 6000 rated players
there) and is gradually improving; it should be somewhat stronger than
this when released.  Since almost all of the CPU time required during
supervised training is spent performing rollouts, and rollouts can
easily be performed in parallel, it is hoped that users will be able to
pool rollout results and collectively train it to a level stronger than
any individual could obtain.
   </para>
   <para>
If you can tolerate the rough edges, periodic pre-releases of the source
will be made on <uref><urefurl>ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/gnubg/</urefurl><urefdesc>the alpha.gnu.org FTP server</urefdesc></uref>.
   </para>
   <para>
Anonymous CVS access to the very latest code is available: if you have a
CVS client, set <code>CVSROOT</code> to
<code>:pserver:anoncvs@subversions.gnu.org:/cvs</code> and check out module
<code>gnubg</code>.  If not, daily snapshots of the CVS repository are made
available by <uref><urefurl>ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/gnubg/snapshots/</urefurl><urefdesc>FTP</urefdesc></uref>, or you
can browse the repository through the
<uref><urefurl>http://subversions.gnu.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/gnubg/</urefurl><urefdesc>WWW gateway</urefdesc></uref>.  Do
not expect this code to be stable; it will generally include both more
features and more bugs than the main pre-release version.
   </para>
   <para>
You can also compete against recent versions of <tt>gnubg</tt> on FIBS; it
plays there under the names <code>gnu</code>, <code>mgnutest</code>, <code>mpgnu</code>
and <code>gnu_one_ply</code>.

    <title>Setup</title>
    <para><indexterm index="cp">board setup</indexterm>
Backgammon is a game for two players, played on a board consisting of
twenty-four narrow triangles called <indexterm index="cp">points</indexterm><dfn>points</dfn>.
The triangles alternate in color and are grouped into four quadrants of
six triangles each.
The quadrants are referred to as a player's
<indexterm index="cp">home board</indexterm><dfn>home board</dfn> and
<indexterm index="cp">outer board</indexterm><dfn>outer board</dfn>, and the opponent's home board and outer board.
The home and outer boards are separated from each other by a ridge down
the center of the board called the
<indexterm index="cp">bar</indexterm><dfn>bar</dfn>.

   </entry></row></multitable>
    <para>
The points are numbered for either player starting in that player's home
board.
The outermost point is the twenty-four point, which is also the opponent's
one point.
Each player has fifteen checkers of his own color.
The initial arrangement of checkers is:
two on each player's twenty-four point, five on each player's thirteen point,
three on each player's eight point, and five on each player's six point.
    </para>
    <para><indexterm index="cp">doubling cube</indexterm>Both players have their own pair of dice and a dice cup used for shaking.
A <dfn>doubling cube</dfn>, with the numerals 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 on its
faces, is used to keep track of the current stake of the game.
    </para></subsection>
   <subsection>
    <title>Object of the Game</title>
    <para><indexterm index="cp">object of the game</indexterm>
The object of the game is for a player to move all of his checkers into
his own home board and then bear them off.
The first player to bear off all of his checkers wins the game.

   <subsection>
    <title>Movement of the Checkers</title>
    <para><indexterm index="cp">moving chequers, rules</indexterm>
To start the game, each player throws a single die.
This determines both the player to go first and the numbers to be played.
If equal numbers come up, then both players roll again until they roll
different numbers.
The player throwing the higher number now moves his checkers according to
the numbers showing on both dice.
After the first roll, the players throw two dice and alternate turns.
    </para>
    <para><indexterm index="cp">pips</indexterm>The roll of the dice indicates how many points, or <dfn>pips</dfn>,
the player is to move his checkers.
The checkers are always moved forward, to a lower-numbered point.
The following rules apply:
    </para>

    <enumerate first="1">
     <item>
      <para><indexterm index="cp">open point</indexterm>A checker may be moved only to an <dfn>open point</dfn>, one that is not
occupied by two or more opposing checkers.
      </para>
</item>
     <item>
      <para>
The numbers on the two dice constitute separate moves.
For example, if a player rolls 5 and 3, he may move one checker five
spaces to an open point and another checker three spaces to an open
point, or he may move the one checker a total of eight spaces to an
open point, but only if the intermediate point (either three or five
spaces from the starting point) is also open.

      <para>
      </para>
</item>
     <item>
      <para>
A player who rolls doubles plays the numbers shown on the dice twice.
A roll of 6 and 6 means that the player has four sixes to use, and he
may move any combination of checkers he feels appropriate to complete
this requirement.
      </para>
</item>
     <item>
      <para>
A player must use both numbers of a roll if this is legally possible
(or all four numbers of a double).
When only one number can be played, the player must play that number.
Or if either number can be played but not both, the player must play
the larger one.
When neither number can be used, the player loses his turn.
In the case of doubles, when all four numbers cannot be played, the
player must play as many numbers as he can.
      </para></item></enumerate></subsection>
   <subsection>
    <title>Hitting and Entering</title>
    <para><indexterm index="cp">hitting</indexterm><indexterm index="cp">entering</indexterm>
A point occupied by a single checker of either color is called a
<indexterm index="cp">blot</indexterm><dfn>blot</dfn>.  If an opposing checker lands on a blot, the blot is <dfn>hit</dfn>
and placed on the bar.
    </para>
    <para>
Any time a player has one or more checkers on the bar, his first obligation
is to
<indexterm index="cp">enter</indexterm><dfn>enter</dfn> those checker(s) into the opposing home board.
A checker is entered by moving it to an open point corresponding to one of
the numbers on the rolled dice.
    </para>
    <para>
For example, if a player rolls 4 and 6, he may enter a checker
onto either the opponent's four point or six point, so long as the
prospective point is not occupied by two or more of the opponent's checkers.
    </para>

checker on the bar, he must enter the checker onto Red's four point
since Red's six point is not open.

   </entry></row></multitable>
    <para>
If neither of the points is open, the player loses his turn.
If a player is able to enter some but not all of his checkers, he must enter
as many as he can and then forfeit the remainder of his turn.
    </para>
    <para>
After the last of a player's checkers has been entered, any unused numbers
on the dice must be played, by moving either the checker that was entered
or a different checker.
    </para></subsection>
   <subsection>
    <title>Bearing Off</title>
    <para><indexterm index="cp">bearing off</indexterm>
Once a player has moved all of his fifteen checkers into his home board,
he may commence <dfn>bearing off</dfn>.
A player bears off a checker by rolling a number that corresponds to the
point on which the checker resides, and then removing that checker from
the board.
Thus, rolling a 6 permits the player to remove a checker from the six point.
    </para>
    <para>
If there is no checker on the point indicated by the roll, the player
must make a legal move using a checker on a higher-numbered point.
If there are no checkers on higher-numbered points, the player is
permitted (and required) to remove a checker from the highest point on
which one of his checkers resides.
A player is under no obligation to bear off if he can make an otherwise
legal move.
    </para>

      <entry><strong>Figure 5.</strong>  White rolls 64 and bears
off two checkers.

   </entry></row></multitable>
    <para>
A player must have all of his active checkers in his home board in order
to bear off.
If a checker is hit during the bear-off process, the player must bring
that checker back to his home board before continuing to bear off.
The first player to bear off all fifteen checkers wins the game.
    </para></subsection>
   <subsection>
    <title>Doubling</title>
    <para><indexterm index="cp">doubling, rules</indexterm>
Backgammon is played for an agreed stake per point.
Each game starts at one point.
During the course of the game, a player who feels he has a sufficient
advantage may propose doubling the stakes.
He may do this only at the start of his own turn and before he has rolled
the dice.
    </para>
    <para>
A player who is offered a double may <dfn>refuse</dfn>, in which case he
concedes the game and pays one point.
Otherwise, he must <dfn>accept</dfn> the double and play on for the new higher
stakes.
A player who accepts a double becomes the
<indexterm index="cp">cube owner</indexterm><dfn>owner of the cube</dfn> and only he may make the next double.
    </para>
    <para>
Subsequent doubles in the same game are called <dfn>redoubles</dfn>.
If a player refuses a redouble, he must pay the number of points that were
at stake prior to the redouble.
Otherwise, he becomes the new owner of the cube and the game continues
at twice the previous stakes.
There is no limit to the number of redoubles in a game.
    </para></subsection>
   <subsection>
    <title>Gammons and Backgammons</title>
    <para><indexterm index="cp">gammons</indexterm><indexterm index="cp">backgammons</indexterm>
At the end of the game, if the losing player has borne off at least one
checker, he loses only the value showing on the doubling cube (one point,
if there have been no doubles).
However, if the loser has <emph>not</emph> borne off any of his checkers,
he is <dfn>gammoned</dfn> and loses <emph>twice</emph> the value of the doubling cube.
Or, worse, if the loser has not borne off any of his checkers and still has
a checker on the bar or in the winner's home board, he is <dfn>backgammoned</dfn>
and loses <emph>three times</emph> the value of the doubling cube.

   <title>Rules for Match Play</title>
   <para><indexterm index="cp">match rules</indexterm>
When backgammon tournaments are held to determine an overall winner,
the usual style of competition is <dfn>match play</dfn>.
Competitors are paired off, and each pair plays a series of games to decide
which player progresses to the next round of the tournament.
This series of games is called a <dfn>match</dfn>.
   </para>
   <para>
Matches are played to a specified number of points.
The first player to accumulate the required points wins the match.
Points are awarded in the usual manner:
one for a single game, two for a gammon, and three for a backgammon.
The doubling cube is used, so the winner receives the value of the game
multiplied by the final value of the doubling cube.
   </para>
   <para>
Matches are normally played using the
<indexterm index="cp">Crawford rule</indexterm><dfn>Crawford rule</dfn>.
The Crawford rule states that if one player reaches a score one point short
of the match, neither player may offer a double in the immediately following
game.
This one game without doubling is called the Crawford game.
Once the Crawford game has been played, if the match has not yet been decided, the doubling
cube is active again.

    <para>
In this example, White and Black are playing a 5-point match.
After three games White has 4 points, which is just one point
short of what he needs.
That triggers the Crawford rule which says there can be no
doubling in next game, Game 4.

   <para>
There is no bonus for winning more than the required number of points
in match play.
The sole goal is to win the match, and the size of the victory doesn't matter.

   <para>
Automatic doubles, beavers, and the Jacoby rule are not used in match play.

   <title>Sample Game</title>
   <para><indexterm index="cp">sample game</indexterm>
Although GNU Backgammon has many commands and options, only a few of them
are used during routine play.  This chapter demonstrates some of those
most commonly used.
   </para>
   <para>
If your <tt>gnubg</tt> installation is complete, you should be able to start it
and see output similar to the following:

   <para>
When you start a game, <tt>gnubg</tt> will (by default) show which player's move it
is; it is displaying <code>(No game)</code> at the moment to indicate that it
isn't anybody's turn.
   </para>
   <para>
GNU Backgammon uses a pseudo-random number generator to produce dice
rolls.  It will normally initialise the state of the generator to
some value based on the current time (and perhaps other system information,
depending what features are available on your platform).  But for purposes
of this example, it will be better to start the generator from a known
state, so that the rolls it generates will be repeatable.  Enter the
following command to change the generator state ("seed"):
   </para>
   <example>

    <para>
(No game) set seed 15
Seed set to 15.
(No game)
    </para></example>   
   <para>
The default settings allow you to play X (the black pieces, if you have
a graphical board window) and the computer will play O (red).  It will
play with no lookahead by default; it is very fast at choosing moves
in this mode (instantaneous, on most hardware) though it does not play
at its full strength.  Let's start a game.

This is the output you will see if a graphical board is unavailable or
disabled; if your environment supports a graphical board, you will see a
better representation of a backgammon board than this.  Exactly the
same information is available, either way.
   </para>
   <para>
You have just won the opening roll (you have a 3, and <tt>gnubg</tt> has a 1) -- the
dice roll is in the bottom right hand corner for the TTY board, or shown
as graphical dice on the right hand side of the board window.  The
position ID (the <code>4HPwATDgc/ABMA</code> in this example) is an encoded
representation of the current position.  It comes in useful when using
some of <tt>gnubg</tt>'s advanced commands, but you can safely ignore it for now.
Notice that the prompt has changed to <code>(user)</code>, to indicate that it
is your turn; on systems where a login name is available, <tt>gnubg</tt> will
use that instead.
   </para>
   <para>
If you are familiar with backgammon, you will know that the best play
for this roll is to make your 5 point.  The command to do that is:

(user) 8 5 6 5

   <para>

in the terminal window (i.e. move one chequer from your 8 point to
your 5 point, and move another from your 6 to your 5 point); or by
dragging each chequer to the destination point in the board window.
Click mouse button 1 on the dice to indicate you have finished your move
(just as you would pick up your dice to end your move if you were
playing on a real board).
   </para>

   <para>
Once you have done that, <tt>gnubg</tt> will take its turn, rolling 63 and playing
24/15.  It is now your move again:

bar.  You can also make this move by dragging chequers in the board window,
of course.

Our position is now strong.  Let's try doubling -- this can be done by
entering the command <kbd>double</kbd> at the prompt, or by clicking the
doubling cube in the board window.  When you are doubled, you should use
the command <kbd>take</kbd> or <kbd>drop</kbd> to accept or refuse the cube.  GNU
Backgammon will drop this double:
   </para>

   <example>

    <para>

gnubg refuses the cube and gives up 1 point.
user wins a single game and 1 points.
The score (after 1 game) is: gnubg 0, user 1 (money session,
without Jacoby rule).
    </para></example>
   <para>
That concludes the example game.  You have seen most of the commands
normally used while playing; others you will need include <kbd>bar</kbd>
when re-entering a hit chequer (e.g. <kbd>bar 20 24 20</kbd>) and
<kbd>off</kbd> to remove a chequer from the board when bearing off
(e.g. <kbd>6 off 5 off</kbd>).
   </para>

You can also instruct <tt>gnubg</tt> to read an existing game or match from a

   <para><tt>gnubg</tt> will give you a short summary of how to invoke it if given the
option <code>-help</code> (<code>-h</code> for short), and report its version
with <code>-version</code> (<code>-v</code>).
   </para>
   <para>
GNU Backgammon will normally use a graphical board window if a window
system is available.  To prevent this behaviour and use standard
terminal output instead, you can specify the <code>-tty</code> option (which
can be abbreviated to <code>-t</code>).
   </para>
   <para>
By default, <tt>gnubg</tt> will attempt to load pre-trained neural net
weights; if you have no weights or wish to train a net from scratch,
you can supply the <code>-no-weights</code> (<code>-n</code>) option, and
new weights will be randomly generated.
   </para>

   <title>Commands Used During the Game</title>
   <para><indexterm index="cp">game commands</indexterm>
   </para>
   <table><indexterm index="ky">new game</indexterm>
    <tableitem>
     <tableterm><code>new game</code></tableterm>
     <item>
      <para>
This command is used to start a game within a match or session.  (Note
that all games are played within matches or sessions; see
<xref><xrefnodename>Matches and Sessions</xrefnodename></xref>.  To play a single game, use either a
1 point match or a session lasting for one game, depending whether
you want gammons and the doubling cube to be active.)  <code>new game</code>
will set up the board in the starting position, and roll one die for
each player for the opening move.
      </para>

      <para>
If you are in the middle of a game, <code>new game</code> will ask you if
you want to abort the game in progress.  If you do, a new game will
replace the current one (i.e. the partially completed game will have
no effect on the score).  If you want the current game to be scored
for either player, you should use the <code>resign</code> command instead.
<indexterm index="ky">move</indexterm>      </para></item></tableitem>
    <tableitem>
     <tableterm><code>move <var>from</var> <var>to</var> &dots;</code></tableterm>
     <tableterm><code>move =<var>number</var></code></tableterm>
     <tableterm><code><var>from</var> <var>to</var> &dots;</code></tableterm>
     <tableterm><code>=<var>number</var></code></tableterm>
     <item>
      <para>

The <code>move</code> command allows you to make chequer plays when it is your
turn.  In its normal form, you should specify pairs of point numbers
indicating the points you want to move a chequer from and to.  Specify
one pair for each chequer you want to move.  (For instance, on an
opening roll of 31, you might use <code>move 8 5 6 5</code> to move two
chequers -- one from your 8 point to your 5 point, and the other from
your 6 point to your 5 point.)  For several example moves, see
<xref><xrefnodename>Sample Game</xrefnodename></xref>.
      </para>

      <para>
You should use the words <code>bar</code> and <code>off</code> when moving a chequer
from the bar or bearing it off the board, e.g. <code>move bar 20</code> or
<code>move 3 off</code>.  These words can be abbreviated to <code>b</code> and
<code>o</code> respectively.
      </para>

      <para>
If there is only one legal move you can make, then the command <code>move</code>
by itself will make it for you without requiring you to specify it in full.
Similarly, if there is no play available at all, then <code>move</code> will
end your turn without moving.
      </para>

      <para>
As long as you specify at least one pair of points, then the word
<code>move</code> is optional -- the command <code>bar 20 24 20</code> means exactly
the same thing as <code>move bar 20 24 20</code>, for instance.
      </para>

      <para>
FIXME document `=n' notation.
      </para>

      <para>
If you are using a window system, you can also move chequers using the
board window.  One way to do this is to use any mouse button to drag a
chequer (that is, press the button when the pointer is over the chequer
you wish to move; move the pointer to the point you wish to play it to,
and then release the button).
      </para>

      <para>
An alternative is to click a mouse button on the chequer; button 1 will
move it by the number of pips showing on the left die, and any other
button will move it according to the right die.  If you don't like the
order the dice are displayed in, pressing either button 2 or 3 on the
dice will swap their positions.
      </para>

      <para>
Whichever method you use to move the chequers, once you have made a legal
move you can end your turn by clicking mouse button 1 on the dice.
      </para>

      <para>
FIXME reference set auto move and set auto bearoff.
<indexterm index="ky">resign</indexterm><indexterm index="ky">agree</indexterm><indexterm index="ky">accept</indexterm><indexterm index="ky">decline</indexterm><indexterm index="ky">reject</indexterm>      </para></item></tableitem>
    <tableitem>
     <tableterm><code>resign [<var>type</var>]</code></tableterm>
     <tableterm><code>agree</code></tableterm>
     <tableterm><code>accept</code></tableterm>
     <tableterm><code>decline</code></tableterm>
     <tableterm><code>reject</code></tableterm>
     <item>
      <para>
The <code>resign</code> command is used to give up a game without playing it to
completion.  It is often useful during endgame play when the game reaches
a position where it is impossible for one player to win.  If you do not
specify a value <var>type</var>, then the player whose turn it is offers to
give up one game (at the current cube value) to the opponent; you can
also specify <code>1</code>, <code>2</code> or <code>3</code> to resign a single, double
or triple game.  Specifying <code>normal</code>, <code>gammon</code> or
<code>backgammon</code> is also legal, and is identical to expressing the
number of points as a digit.  <code>single</code> is yet another synonym for
one game.
      </para>

      <para>
The opponent may accept the resignation with either the <code>agree</code> or
<code>accept</code> commands, but is not obliged to.  To ignore the
resignation and continue play normally, use either the <code>decline</code> or
<code>reject</code> commands.  (<code>accept</code> and <code>reject</code> are also legal
commands in response to a double; <xref><xrefnodename>Cube</xrefnodename></xref>.)
<indexterm index="ky">set board</indexterm>      </para></item></tableitem>
    <tableitem>
     <tableterm><code>set board <var>id</var>|=<var>number</var></code></tableterm>
     <item>
      <para>
If you wish to directly set the chequers to a different position, you
can use the <code>set board</code> command.  You need to know the
<dfn>position ID</dfn> of the chequer arrangement you want; position IDs
are always displayed when the board is shown.  (If you are playing
on a text terminal, the position ID is in the upper right hand corner
of the board diagram; when using the board window, the ID is shown
below the board on the right hand side.)  For instance, to set the
chequers to the starting position, use the command
<code>set board 4HPwATDgc/ABMA</code>.
      </para>

      <para>
FIXME reference =n notation and describe the GTK edit mode
<indexterm index="ky">show board</indexterm>      </para></item></tableitem>
    <tableitem>
     <tableterm><code>show board [<var>id</var>|=<var>number</var>]</code></tableterm>
     <item>
      <para>
The <code>show board</code> command is used to display a particular position --
normally the board of the current game, but it is also possible to view
unrelated layouts.  When specified without the optional <var>id</var> parameter,
the current position is displayed.  (When using a text terminal, this
is useful if subsequent output has caused the board diagram to scroll
off the screen.  In the board window, the command can be used to undo
erroneous chequer plays by resetting the window to the position at the
start of the turn.)
      </para>

      <para>
When a position ID <var>id</var> is given, the chequers are arranged into
the position specified and that board is displayed.  Note that this
command affects the display only; the current game is unchanged.  Use
the <code>show board</code> command with no parameter if you want to see
the current game again.
<indexterm index="ky">hint</indexterm>      </para></item></tableitem>
    <tableitem>
     <tableterm><code>hint</code></tableterm>
     <item>
      <para>
At any time during the game when the dice have been rolled, you can
use the <code>hint</code> command to see the moves <tt>gnubg</tt> recommends.
The output is of the following form:
      </para>

      <example>
       <group>Win    W(g)   W(bg)  L(g)   L(bg)  Equity       Move
0.542  0.142  0.008  0.113  0.008  (+0.114)     6/5 8/5
0.505  0.120  0.008  0.122  0.007  (+0.009)     24/23 23/20
0.498  0.126  0.008  0.123  0.007  (+0.000)     24/23 13/10

0.486  0.125  0.008  0.120  0.009  (-0.024)     13/10 10/9
0.481  0.116  0.008  0.129  0.008  (-0.051)     6/5 24/21
0.472  0.122  0.008  0.129  0.009  (-0.064)     6/5 13/10
</group>          </example>
      <para>
      </para>

      <para>
The moves are listed in descending order of preference, so in this case,
<tt>gnubg</tt> recommends the move <code>6/5 8/5</code>.  The first five columns are
its estimates of the probability of the player on roll winning
(<code>Win</code>), winning a gammon (<code>W(g)</code>), winning a backgammon
(<code>W(bg)</code>), losing a gammon (<code>L(g)</code>), and losing a backgammon
(<code>L(bg)</code>) if the game is played to completion without use of the
doubling cube, after the candidate move in that row is
made<footnote><para>Note that the probability of winning includes the
probability of winning a gammon or backgammon, and likewise the gammon
probabilities include the backgammon probabilities.</para></footnote>.  The sixth column,
<code>Equity</code>, is the estimated cubeless equity following the move --
this is the expected number of points per game won by the player on
roll.
      </para>

      <para>
FIXME describe =n notation.
      </para>

      <para><tt>gnubg</tt> will `look ahead' a certain number of moves when evaluating
the probabilities, according to the search depth set by the

     <item>
      <para>
Use <code>show pipcount</code> to automatically count the number of `pips'
each player needs to bear off.  Depending on the position, the output
will look something like:

      <example>

       <para>

     <tableterm><code>set player <var>old-name</var> name <var>new-name</var></code></tableterm>
     <item>
      <para>
Both players have a certain amount of configuration information; use the
command <code>show player</code> to summarise these settings.  By default,
<tt>gnubg</tt> will play for player 0, whose name is initially <code>gnubg</code>.
Player 1 defaults to a human (i.e. <tt>gnubg</tt> will prompt the user
for a move when it is player 1's turn) whose name is the user's login
name, on systems where this information is available; on single-user
systems, the default name <code>user</code> applies.
      </para>

      <para>
Either player can be set to a human with the command <code>set player
<var>name</var> human</code>, where <var>name</var> is either the number of the player
(0 or 1) or that player's name (initially <code>gnubg</code> and <code>user</code>
or the user's login name).  You can also specify <code>both</code> which will
set both players simultaneously.  There are also options for computer
players (<xref><xrefnodename>Computer Player</xrefnodename></xref>).
      </para>

      <para>
You can change the names of the players with the
<code>set player <var>old-name</var> name <var>new-name</var></code> command.  Again,
either the player numbers or names are valid for the <var>old-name</var>
parameter.  Names may not contain whitespace characters, and may not
be longer than 31 characters.  The names <code>0</code>, <code>1</code> and
<code>both</code> are not permitted, to avoid ambiguities, and the players
may not both share the same name.  Names are not case sensitive.

     <item>
      <para>
The command <code>set turn <var>player</var></code> (where <var>player</var> can be the
player's name or number, as above) is used to control which player is on
roll.  It will cancel the current dice roll and cube action (if any),
and set the named player on roll.

     <item>
      <para>
By default, <tt>gnubg</tt> will update the display before and after every move,
whether made by a human or automatically.  (When using the graphical board,
the board window is redrawn to the current position; when using the ASCII
board, a new diagram is displayed on the terminal.)  Information about
cube actions and resignations offered will also appear as appropriate.
      </para>

      <para>
The command <code>set display off</code> will suppress this output, which can
speed up the display and reduce clutter (this might be useful when completing
a game where both sides are played by the computer, for instance).
<code>set display on</code> will restore the default behaviour.  The standard
toggle synonyms may be substituted for <code>on</code> and <code>off</code>.
      </para>

      <para>
The board will always be updated when it is a human player's turn to move,
regardless of the <code>display</code> setting.

     <tableterm><code>roll</code></tableterm>
     <item>
      <para>
This is the basic command used to roll the dice before each turn.  It will
use the current random number generator to produce a dice roll, and then
allow the player to move (if there is at least one legal play for the
dice rolled).  By rolling the dice, the player gives up any opportunity
to double this turn.

     <item>
      <para>
When the cube is not being used, or is owned by the opponent, or at
certain scores in a match, it is either illegal or pointless for a
player to double.  Under these circumstances, the player might as well
roll the dice immediately -- the <code>set automatic roll</code> command
instructs <tt>gnubg</tt> to go ahead and roll the dice without waiting for the
player to issue <code>roll</code>, whenever no doubling decision is necessary.
The standard toggle commands may be used to turn this option on and off.

     <item>
      <para>
To set the dice to a particular roll (whether they have already been rolled
or not), use the <code>set dice</code> command.  The player can then play a move
according to the dice specified.  Like the <code>roll</code> command, this will
also forego any opportunity to double; to disregard a dice roll and
allow the player to roll again (or double, if permitted), use <code>set
turn <var>player</var></code>.

         <para>
The ANSI C standard <code>rand()</code> random number generator.  The
behaviour of this generator will depend on the C library linked with
<tt>gnubg</tt>, but is typically a linear congruential pseudo-random number
generator.  Such generators have fairly weak distribution properties,
but are generally adequate for producing backgammon dice.  However, the
ANSI generator is not recommended for performing rollouts, because any
small biases in the dice could accumulate over hundreds or thousands of
trials and distort the results.  Using a better generator would be
safer for rollouts.

The 4.3BSD <code>random()</code> non-linear additive feedback random number
generator.  This is a good quality generator, but is not available on
all systems.  <tt>gnubg</tt> will report an error if you attempt to use this
generator if the C library used in your installation does not include

MD5 is a public domain message digest algorithm invented by Ron
Rivest and documented in RFC 1321.  <tt>gnubg</tt> can use MD5 as a procedure
for generating dice rolls -- this generator has the property that
the seed increments by one each roll, and so the sequence generated
by seed <code>n+1</code> will be identical to that generated by seed <code>n</code>,
with the first roll omitted.  The command <code>show seed</code> is available
when using the <var>md5</var> generator, for obtaining the current seed value.

An alternative computer player can be chosen by setting a player to
<code>pubeval</code>.  This will cause moves for that player to be made by
Gerry Tesauro's benchmark player.  <code>pubeval</code> is much weaker than
<tt>gnubg</tt>'s own evaluator, but provides a constant level of play which
is useful for measuring different players against.
      </para>

      <para><code>pubeval</code> is not capable of making cube or resignation decisions
based on the position.  It will never accept resignations at less than
triple (backgammon) stakes, and will take all cubes.  It nevers offers
resignations or doubles of its own.

Once you are running <tt>gnubg</tt>, enter <kbd>new game</kbd> at the
<code>(gnubg)</code> prompt to start a game against the computer opponent.
You should now see a board (if a window system is available, <tt>gnubg</tt>
will use a graphical board window; otherwise, it will display an ASCII
board on your terminal).  If <tt>gnubg</tt> won the opening roll, it will have
moved; you can now type <kbd>roll</kbd> (or click on the dice below the board
window) to roll the dice yourself.  In either case, it will now be your
move; you should enter the moves for each chequer as pairs of numbers.
For instance, if you have rolled 3 and 1, you could type <kbd>8 5 6 5</kbd>
to move one chequer from the 8 point to the 5 point and another from the
6 point to the 5 point.  Use <kbd>bar</kbd> to move from the bar, and
<kbd>off</kbd> to bear off.  If you are using the board window, you can also
drag chequers around the board.  Click on the dice when you have
finished.

   <para><indexterm index="vr">gnubg.bd</indexterm><indexterm index="cp">errors starting <tt>gnubg</tt></indexterm>
The file <code>gnubg.bd</code> is the bearoff database that <tt>gnubg</tt> uses to
evaluate endgame positions.  <tt>gnubg</tt> will look for it first in the current
directory and then in the installed directory (<code>/usr/local/share/gnubg/</code>
by default).
   </para>
   <para>
The <tt>gnubg</tt> distribution is set up to create <code>gnubg.bd</code> by itself
during compilation, but it can be a slow process (taking half an hour
or more, depending on the speed of your computer).  If you would rather
not wait to generate the database yourself, you can obtain a copy
via FTP from <uref><urefurl>ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/gnubg/gnubg.bd.gz</urefurl></uref>.

   <para><indexterm index="vr">gnubg.weights</indexterm><indexterm index="cp">errors starting <tt>gnubg</tt></indexterm>
The file <code>gnubg.weights</code> contains the trained neural net weights
for most of <tt>gnubg</tt>'s position evaluators.  Like <code>gnubg.bd</code>, it should
be kept in either the current directory or the installed directory.
   </para>
   <para>
A binary variant of the weights file named <code>gnubg.wd</code> can also be
used (this version can be loaded more quickly, but is not portable
between different computer architectures).  It will automatically be
built during the compilation process, and used in preference to
<code>gnubg.weights</code> if found.
   </para>
   <para>
You should be able to obtain a copy of the weights from wherever you
found the <tt>gnubg</tt> distribution.  If you wish to start <tt>gnubg</tt> without
any weights (and train your own), you can use the <code>-no-weights</code>
option (see <xref><xrefnodename>Invoking gnubg</xrefnodename></xref>).

   <title>The board window is shown in black and white and looks awful!  What's wrong?</title>
   <para>
If you see this problem, your X server is probably using a
<dfn>PseudoColor</dfn> visual, and is dynamically allocating colours
to clients from a limited colourmap.  On these types of displays,
<tt>gnubg</tt> tries to be a well-behaved client by using colours from the
default standard colourmap.  This will allow it to share colours
with other clients that use the same scheme, which will help them
all to use as many colours as possible without exhausting the
colourmap.
   </para>
   <para>
Unfortunately, not all X clients use standard colourmaps.  If other
clients have been run before <tt>gnubg</tt> and allocated most of the colours,
then there may not be enough left for <tt>gnubg</tt> to allocate a standard
colourmap.  If this happens, it will just take what it can get (which
in the worst case might be black and white only).  You can try to
avoid this problem by running <tt>gnubg</tt> before other colour-hungry clients,
or by using the <code>xstdcmap</code> utility to install the default
standard colourmap early in your session while colours are still
available.  Depending on your hardware, you may be able to configure
your display to allow more colours, or use a <dfn>DirectColor</dfn> or
<dfn>TrueColor</dfn> visual which should resolve the problem.
   </para>
   <para>
Of course, if your X server can only display black and white (not even
shades of grey), then there's not much you can do!

    <title>APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS</title>
    <para>
This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a
notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
under the terms of this License.  The "Document", below, refers to any
such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee, and is
addressed as "you".
    </para>
    <para>
A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.
    </para>
    <para>
A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject
(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
within that overall subject.  (For example, if the Document is in part a
textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.
    </para>
    <para>
The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.
    </para>
    <para>
The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.

A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage
subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is
not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".
    </para>
    <para>
Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
HTML designed for human modification.  Opaque formats include
PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only
by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output
purposes only.
    </para>
    <para>
The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

    <title>VERBATIM COPYING</title>
    <para>
You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
    </para>
    <para>
You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.
    </para></unnumberedsec>
   <unnumberedsec>
    <title>COPYING IN QUANTITY</title>
    <para>
If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100,
and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose
the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.
    </para>
    <para>
If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.
    </para>
    <para>
If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete
Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the
general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the latter
option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this
Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location
until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque
copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to
the public.
    </para>
    <para>
It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
    </para></unnumberedsec>
   <unnumberedsec>
    <title>MODIFICATIONS</title>
    <para>
You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
    </para>

    <enumerate first="A">
     <item>
      <para>
Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
      </para>
</item>
     <item>
      <para>
 List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five).
      </para>
</item>
     <item>
      <para>
State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
Modified Version, as the publisher.
      </para>

      <para>
 Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
      </para>

Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
adjacent to the other copyright notices.
      </para>

      <para>
Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
      </para>
</item>
     <item>
      <para>
Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.

     <item>
      <para>
Include an unaltered copy of this License.
      </para>
</item>
     <item>
      <para>
Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and add to
it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
there is no section entitled "History" in the Document, create one
stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
Version as stated in the previous sentence.
      </para>
</item>
     <item>
      <para>
Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
      </para>
</item>
     <item>
      <para>
In any section entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the
substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
and/or dedications given therein.
      </para>
</item>
     <item>
      <para>
Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
      </para>
</item>
     <item>
      <para>
Delete any section entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
may not be included in the Modified Version.
      </para>
</item>
     <item>
      <para>
Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements"
or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
      </para></item></enumerate>        
    <para>
If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.
    </para>
    <para>
You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties-for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.
    </para>
    <para>
You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.
    </para>
    <para>
The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.
    </para></unnumberedsec>
   <unnumberedsec>
    <title>COMBINING DOCUMENTS</title>
    <para>
You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice.
    </para>
    <para>
The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
    </para>
    <para>
In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "History"
in the various original documents, forming one section entitled
"History"; likewise combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgements",
and any sections entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections
entitled "Endorsements."
    </para></unnumberedsec>
   <unnumberedsec>
    <title>COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS</title>
    <para>
You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.
    </para>
    <para>
You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.
    </para></unnumberedsec>
   <unnumberedsec>
    <title>AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS</title>
    <para>
A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version
of the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the
compilation.  Such a compilation is called an "aggregate", and this
License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled
with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they
are not themselves derivative works of the Document.
    </para>
    <para>
If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter
of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that surround only the Document within the aggregate.
Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate.
    </para></unnumberedsec>
   <unnumberedsec>
    <title>TRANSLATION</title>
    <para>
Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License provided that you also include the
original English version of this License.  In case of a disagreement
between the translation and the original English version of this
License, the original English version will prevail.
    </para></unnumberedsec>
   <unnumberedsec>
    <title>TERMINATION</title>
    <para>
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to
copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

    <title>FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE</title>
    <para>
The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.
    </para>
    <para>
Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
