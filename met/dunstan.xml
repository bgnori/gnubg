<description>Match Equity Table generated by Gnubg 2-ply rollouts</description>
<!-- This MET has been generated by Gnubg 0.14 (2-Ply 50% Move,
2-Ply 33% Cube). The move filter was set to “Add extra 5 moves within 0.1”
and most table entries were rolled out to 12960 trials. The table entries
1a2a Crawford and 1a2a Post-Crawford were both rolled out to 25920 trials.
The second decimal place is shown for all entries, but the table is
certainly not this accurate. I estimate (no statistical analysis was
performed) that the “true” values are predominately within +- 0.1 of the
shown table entries.  -->
